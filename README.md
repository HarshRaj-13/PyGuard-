## <a name="links">🤖 Introduction</a>
This project is to create a Voice Activated Desktop Assistant with the use of  Python programming language.Voice assistants are software agents that can interpret human speech and respond via synthesized voices. Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Microsoft’s Cortana, and Google’s Assistant are the most popular voice assistants and are embedded in smartphones or dedicated home speakers.

## <a name="links">⚙️ Objectives</a>
- The main Objective of this project is to  implement coding in the field of mechanical aspect in order to drive the mechanical components more effectively and efficiently. 
- This project is used to activate Servo Motor using voice command with the use of Python programming language.
- By making this voice activated Servo Motor , Our project can be extended further, such as in making robotic arms , automatic door , mini plotter.
